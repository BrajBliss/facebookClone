# Facebook Clone

Simple FB Clone using MERN Stack

## Features

## Installation

### Install all dependencies from `package.json` files in both server and client sides

### Use Amazon, Firebase or something for uploading images but I have just used server side. Not a good idea.

### Create `.env` file in server side and put

```
MONGO_URL = yourMongoDBConnectionURL
```
